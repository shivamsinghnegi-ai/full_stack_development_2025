### 1. “Introduce yourself as a software developer.”

I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in building end-to-end web applications using modern frontend and backend technologies. On the frontend, I work extensively with React to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces, and on the backend I handle APIs, authentication, and database interactions. I focus on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code, and I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology. I continuously work on improving my technical skills and understanding best practices so that I can contribute effectively in a professional development team.

### 2. “Explain one technical project you have worked on in simple terms.”

I worked on a Full Stack web application designed to help users manage their data through a secure online platform. In simple terms, the application allows users to create an account, log in securely, and then view, add, update, or delete their information using a dashboard. Instead of storing data manually or offline, everything is handled digitally, making it more efficient and reliable. The project focuses on ease of use, data security, and smooth interaction between the user interface and the backend system.

---

### 3. “Why did you choose the technology used in your project?”

I chose Full Stack technologies because they provide flexibility and efficiency when developing both the frontend and backend of an application. Using React on the frontend allows me to build reusable components, manage UI state efficiently, and create a smooth user experience. The backend technologies handle business logic, data storage, and APIs effectively. This combination helps in building scalable applications and makes maintenance and future updates easier.

### 4. “Describe a challenge or failure you faced and how you handled it.”

One challenge I faced was managing complex state in a React application, which initially caused performance issues and unexpected behavior. Instead of making quick fixes, I took time to analyze the component structure and identify where state was being mismanaged. I refactored the code by organizing state more efficiently and reusing components properly. Through this experience, I learned the importance of planning application architecture early and writing optimized frontend logic.

### 5. “How would you approach solving a technical problem or bug?”

When I encounter a technical problem, I first make sure I fully understand the issue by reproducing it if possible. Then I break the problem into smaller parts to identify the root cause. I use debugging tools, logs, and code reviews to analyze what is going wrong. If required, I refer to documentation or trusted resources. After implementing a solution, I thoroughly test it to ensure it solves the problem without creating new issues.

### 6. “Describe how you would respectfully disagree with a teammate or senior when you have a different technical opinion.”

If I disagree with a teammate or senior, I first listen carefully to their point of view to understand their reasoning. Then I calmly present my perspective using logical explanations, examples, or data. I keep the discussion focused on what is best for the project rather than making it personal. I remain open to feedback and am willing to adjust my opinion if a better solution is presented.

---

### 7. “Explain a technical concept you know to a beginner.”

I would explain React components as small, reusable pieces of a user interface, similar to building blocks. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the screen, such as a button or a form. By combining multiple components, we can build a complete application. This approach makes the code easier to manage, reuse, and update, especially as applications grow larger.

---

### 8. “How do you handle feedback or criticism on your code?”

I view feedback as an important part of learning and improving as a developer. When I receive criticism, I focus on understanding the reason behind it instead of taking it personally. I apply the suggested improvements and try to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. Feedback helps me write better code and work more effectively in a team environment.

---

### 9. “Describe how you work when assigned a task with a strict deadline.”

When working under a strict deadline, I start by clearly understanding the requirements and identifying the most important features. I break the task into smaller steps and prioritize work that has the highest impact. I focus on delivering a stable and functional solution rather than adding unnecessary features. If I foresee any risks or delays, I communicate them early to manage expectations.

---

### 10. “How do you communicate a technical issue to a non-technical person?”

When explaining a technical issue to a non-technical person, I avoid using complex technical terms. I explain the problem in simple language, focusing on what went wrong, how it affects the system or users, and what steps are being taken to fix it. My goal is to ensure they understand the situation without overwhelming them with technical details.

---

### 11. “What do you do when you are stuck on a technical problem?”

If I get stuck on a technical problem, I first review my code carefully and try debugging different parts of it. If that does not help, I refer to official documentation or trusted online resources. I also discuss the problem with teammates if needed, as a fresh perspective often helps. This process allows me to learn and improve while solving the issue efficiently.

---

### 12. “Describe your role when working in a team project.”

In a team project, I take responsibility for my assigned tasks while actively communicating with other team members. I contribute by writing quality code, reviewing others’ work when needed, and sharing ideas during discussions. I also support teammates if they face difficulties, as teamwork is essential for project success.

---

### 13. “How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple assignments?”

I prioritize tasks based on deadlines, importance, and the effort required. Tasks that are time-sensitive or critical to the project are handled first. I plan my work in advance, track progress, and adjust priorities if requirements change. This helps me manage multiple assignments effectively without missing deadlines.

---

### 14. “Tell me about a time you helped a teammate with a technical issue.”

Once, a teammate was struggling with a frontend issue that was causing incorrect UI behavior. I reviewed their code, identified the root cause, and explained the problem along with the solution. This not only helped fix the issue but also improved our collaboration and shared understanding within the team.

---

### 15. “How do you ensure your code is clean and understandable for others?”

I ensure my code is clean by using meaningful variable and function names, maintaining proper folder structure, and following consistent coding standards. I break complex logic into smaller, reusable components or functions and add comments only where necessary. This makes the code easier for others to read, understand, and maintain.

---

### 16. “What would you do if you strongly disagreed with your team’s technical approach?”

If I strongly disagreed with the team’s approach, I would clearly explain my concerns with logical reasoning and possible alternatives. I would listen to the team’s feedback and aim for a solution that benefits the project overall. If the final decision goes against my suggestion, I would still support it professionally and work towards successful implementation.
