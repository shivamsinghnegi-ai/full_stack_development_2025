# Kanban Methodology

---

## 1. Introduction to Kanban

Kanban is an Agile methodology that focuses on **visualizing work**, **limiting work in progress**, and **improving flow**. Unlike Scrum, Kanban does not rely on fixed iterations or time-boxed sprints. Instead, it emphasizes continuous delivery and gradual improvement.

Kanban is particularly effective in environments where work arrives unpredictably and priorities change frequently. It helps teams manage work efficiently without disrupting ongoing tasks.

## 2. Core Principles of Kanban

Kanban is built on a few simple but powerful principles:

* Visualize the workflow
* Limit work in progress (WIP)
* Manage and improve flow
* Make process policies explicit
* Continuously improve

These principles guide how teams organize, track, and optimize their work.

## 3. Visualizing Work Using a Kanban Board

The Kanban board is the most recognizable element of the Kanban methodology. It visually represents the stages of work and the status of tasks.

A typical Kanban board includes columns such as:

* To Do
* In Progress
* Testing
* Done

Each task is represented as a card that moves across the board as work progresses.

### Example

A **software maintenance team** managing bug fixes uses a Kanban board:

* New bugs are added to “To Do”
* Developers pull tasks into “In Progress”
* Completed fixes move to “Testing” and then “Done”

This visualization allows everyone to see:

* What is being worked on
* What is blocked
* Where bottlenecks exist

## 4. Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)

One of the most important concepts in Kanban is limiting work in progress. WIP limits restrict how many tasks can be in a given stage at the same time.

The goal is to:

* Prevent multitasking
* Reduce context switching
* Improve focus and quality

### Example

If the “In Progress” column has a WIP limit of 3:

* Only three tasks can be worked on simultaneously
* New tasks must wait until one is completed

This forces the team to finish work before starting new tasks, improving flow and reducing delays.

---

## 5. Managing Flow in Kanban

Kanban focuses on how work flows through the system rather than how much work is started.

Key flow-related questions include:

* How long does a task take from start to finish?
* Where does work get stuck?
* Which stages cause delays?

### Example

If tasks consistently pile up in the “Testing” column, it indicates:

* Insufficient testing resources
* Poor code quality
* Lack of automation

The team can then address the root cause instead of pushing more work into development.

---

## 6. Continuous Delivery in Kanban

Because Kanban does not use sprints, work is delivered continuously as soon as it is ready.

### Example

In a **production support team**:

* Bug fixes are deployed as soon as testing is complete
* There is no need to wait for a sprint boundary
* Urgent issues are addressed immediately

This makes Kanban ideal for:

* Maintenance work
* Support teams
* Operations-heavy environments

---

## 7. Making Process Policies Explicit

Kanban encourages teams to clearly define how work is handled at each stage.

Examples of explicit policies include:

* When a task can move to the next column
* Definition of “Done”
* Rules for prioritization

### Example

A team defines “Done” as:

* Code written
* Tests passed
* Code reviewed
* Deployed to production

This clarity reduces confusion and inconsistency.

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement Using Kanban

Kanban promotes incremental improvement rather than radical change. Teams regularly analyze their workflow and make small adjustments.

### Example

After observing frequent delays, a team:

* Adjusts WIP limits
* Improves test automation
* Reorganizes workflow stages

These changes are introduced gradually without disrupting ongoing work.

---

## 9. Kanban vs Scrum 

### Scrum Example

A product development team uses:

* Fixed two-week sprints
* Planned sprint goals
* Sprint reviews and retrospectives

Best suited for:

* Feature development
* New product creation

### Kanban Example

A support team handles:

* Bug fixes
* Small enhancements
* Operational tasks

Best suited for:

* Continuous flow
* Unpredictable work

Many teams use Scrum for development and Kanban for maintenance.

---

## 10. When Kanban Works Best

Kanban is most effective when:

* Work arrives continuously
* Priorities change frequently
* Tasks vary in size
* Continuous delivery is required

It is less suitable when teams require strict planning cycles or long-term sprint commitments.

---

## 11. Kanban’s Role in Modern Agile Environments

Kanban integrates easily with other Agile frameworks and is often used alongside Scrum. It also aligns well with DevOps practices, where continuous delivery and flow optimization are critical.

By focusing on visibility, flow, and incremental improvement, Kanban helps teams deliver value consistently and efficiently.
