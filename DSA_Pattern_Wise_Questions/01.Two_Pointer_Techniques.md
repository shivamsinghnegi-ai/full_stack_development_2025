# Two Pointer Techniques

**Two Pointers** is one of the easiest and most powerful tricks in coding interviews.  
Instead of using two nested loops (which take O(n²) time and are slow), we use **two pointers** to solve many problems in **O(n)** time — much faster!

There are **two main patterns**:

1. **Left & Right Pointers** (they move **towards each other** – opposite directions)
2. **Slow & Fast Pointers** (they move in the **same direction**, but one is faster)

---

## Pattern 1: Left & Right Pointers (Opposite Direction)

**What happens?**  
- One pointer starts at the **beginning** (left = 0)  
- Another starts at the **end** (right = n-1)  
- They move **towards the center** until they meet (left < right)

**Super simple visual example**  
Imagine you have numbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] and want pairs that sum to 10.  
Start left at 1, right at 9 → sum = 10 → found!  
(You move them closer only when needed.)

**When should you think of this pattern?** (Beginner checklist – ask yourself these questions)

- Is the array or string **sorted**? (or can we sort it quickly?) → Very strong signal!
- Do we need to find **two numbers** that add up to something (sum, closest sum)?
- Is it about **palindrome** (reads same forward & backward)?
- Do we compare things from **both ends** (like reversing string, vowels)?
- Problems like maximum area, trapping water, boats/people grouping?
- You feel like "I want to look at start and end at the same time"

**Real-life analogy**  
Two people standing at opposite ends of a line of people. They walk towards each other checking pairs until they meet in the middle.

## Pattern 2: Slow & Fast Pointers (Same Direction)

**What happens?**  
- Both pointers start from the **same side** (usually left / head)  
- **Fast** pointer moves quicker (often 2 steps)  
- **Slow** pointer moves slowly (1 step)  
- Fast gives info to slow (like "skip this", "this is valid")

**Super simple example**  
Finding middle of list: fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1 → when fast ends, slow is at middle!

**When should you think of this pattern?** (Beginner checklist)

- We have to **remove duplicates** or **move zeroes** or **filter** in-place?
- Need **O(1)** extra space (no new array)?
- Linked list problems: **cycle**, **middle**, **nth from end**, **palindrome**?
- One pointer "reads ahead" and the other "writes" valid elements
- Words like "in-place", "constant space", "Floyd's cycle", "tortoise and hare"

**Real-life analogy**  
Tortoise (slow) and Hare (fast) running on same track. If hare laps tortoise → cycle!
