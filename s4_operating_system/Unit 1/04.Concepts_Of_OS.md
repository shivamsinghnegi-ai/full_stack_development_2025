## Concepts of Operating Systems

### 1. Process Management
- **Process**: A program in execution
- **Process States**: New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated
- **Process Scheduling**: Deciding which process runs next
- **Context Switching**: Switching between processes

### 2. Memory Management
- **Main Memory**: Fast storage for programs and data
- **Virtual Memory**: Extension of physical memory using disk
- **Memory Allocation**: Assigning memory to processes
- **Memory Protection**: Preventing processes from accessing each other's memory

### 3. File Management
- **File System**: Organization of files on storage
- **Directory Structure**: Hierarchical organization of files
- **File Operations**: Create, read, write, delete files
- **Access Control**: Permissions and security

### 4. Device Management
- **Device Drivers**: Software to control hardware
- **I/O Scheduling**: Managing I/O requests
- **Device Allocation**: Assigning devices to processes
- **Interrupt Handling**: Responding to hardware events

### 5. Security and Protection
- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: Controlling access to resources
- **Encryption**: Protecting data
- **Firewall**: Network security

### 6. Networking
- **Network Protocols**: Rules for communication
- **Socket Programming**: Network communication interface
- **Distributed Systems**: Multiple computers working together
- **Cloud Computing**: Remote resource access
