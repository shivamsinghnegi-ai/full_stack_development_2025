# Views of Operating System

---

## Introduction

We can observe the Operating System from **two main views**:

1. **User View**
2. **System View**

## 1. User View

> **Definition**: The User View depends on the **system interface** that is used by **users**.

The user view varies based on what type of system the user is interacting with.

### Types of User Views:

---

### 1.1 Single User View

**What is it?**
- Most computer users use a **monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer**, and other accessories to operate their computer system.
- The system is designed to **maximize the output of a single user**.

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Maximize output for ONE user |
| **Priority** | Accessibility and ease of use |
| **Resource Allocation** | Less important (only one user) |
| **Interface** | Monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer |

**Examples:**
- Personal Computers (PCs)
- Laptops
- Desktop Mac

**Simple Memory Trick:**
> "Single User = Single Focus = **Ease of Use** over Resource Management"

---

### 1.2 Multi User View

**What is it?**
- User sits at a **terminal** connected to a **mainframe computer** or a **minicomputer**
- **Other users** are also accessing the **same computer** through other terminals
- Users **share resources** and may **exchange information**

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Maximize resource utilization |
| **Goal** | Fair sharing of CPU time, memory, and I/O |
| **Priority** | No user should take more than their fair share |
| **Connection** | Terminals connected to central computer |

**How OS handles Multi-User:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           MAINFRAME/MINICOMPUTER        │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │    Shared Resources             │    │
│  │  • CPU Time                     │    │
│  │  • Memory                       │    │
│  │  • I/O Devices                  │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘    │
└────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┘
         │          │          │
    ┌────┴───┐ ┌────┴───┐ ┌────┴───┐
    │Terminal│ │Terminal│ │Terminal│
    │ User 1 │ │ User 2 │ │ User 3 │
    └────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
```

**Examples:**
- University computer labs
- Banking systems
- Time-sharing systems (UNIX)

**Simple Memory Trick:**
> "Multi User = **Fair Share** = Everyone gets equal CPU, memory, I/O"

---

### 1.3 Handheld User View

**What is it?**
- Many varieties of **mobile computers** like **smartphones** and **tablets**
- Most mobile computers are **standalone units** for **individual users**
- Connected to networks through **cellular** or other **wireless technologies**

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Interface** | Touch screen (pressing and swiping) |
| **Input Method** | Finger gestures instead of keyboard/mouse |
| **Connectivity** | Cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth |
| **Usage** | Individual, portable use |

**Examples:**
- Smartphones (Android, iPhone)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)
- Smartwatches

**Simple Memory Trick:**
> "Handheld = **Touch & Swipe** = No keyboard/mouse needed"

---

### 1.4 Embedded User View

**What is it?**
- Some computers have **little or no user view**
- Embedded computers in **home devices** and **automobiles**
- May have **numeric keypads** and **indicator lights**
- Designed primarily to **run without user intervention**

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User Interface** | Minimal or none |
| **Design Goal** | Run autonomously |
| **Interaction** | Limited (buttons, lights, keypads) |
| **Focus** | Specific task automation |

**Examples:**
- Washing Machine
- Car Engine Control Unit
- Thermostat
- Smart TV
- Gaming consoles

**Simple Memory Trick:**
> "Embedded = **Hidden OS** = Works silently in background"

---

## 2. System View

> From the **computer's point of view**, the Operating System is the program **most intimately involved with the hardware**.

### Types of System Views:

---

### 2.1 Resource Allocator

**What is it?**
- OS viewed as a **Resource Allocator** or **Resource Manager**
- A computer has many resources required to solve a problem
- The OS acts as the **manager of these resources**

**Resources Managed by OS:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         RESOURCES MANAGED BY OS            │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   CPU Time         │   Memory Space    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   File Storage     │   I/O Devices     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Network Access   │   Hardware Devices│
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Role** | Manager of all system resources |
| **Goal** | Efficient and fair resource allocation |
| **Resources** | CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices |
| **Decision Making** | Who gets what resource and when |

**How Resource Allocator Works:**
1. **Requests** come from various programs
2. OS **decides** which request to fulfill
3. OS **allocates** resources efficiently
4. OS **deallocates** when no longer needed

**Simple Memory Trick:**
> "Resource Allocator = OS is the **MANAGER** of CPU, Memory, I/O, Storage"

---

### 2.2 Control Program

**What is it?**
- OS viewed as a **Control Program**
- Emphasizes the need to **control** I/O devices and user programs
- **Manages execution** of user programs
- **Prevents errors** and **improper use** of the computer

**Key Points:**
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Role** | Controller of all operations |
| **Focus** | I/O devices and user programs |
| **Goal** | Prevent errors and misuse |
| **Concern** | Operation and control of I/O devices |

**What Control Program Does:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         CONTROL PROGRAM FUNCTIONS       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✓ Manages execution of user programs    │
│ ✓ Prevents errors in program execution  │
│ ✓ Prevents improper use of computer     │
│ ✓ Controls I/O devices operations       │
│ ✓ Handles system security               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Simple Memory Trick:**
> "Control Program = OS is the **CONTROLLER** that prevents errors & controls I/O"

### User View - Remember These:

1. **Single User View**
   - Designed for **ONE user**
   - Focus on **accessibility**, not resource allocation
   - Example: Personal Computer

2. **Multi User View**
   - Multiple users on **same computer** via terminals
   - OS ensures **fair resource sharing**
   - No user takes more than **fair share**

3. **Handheld User View**

   - Runs **without user intervention**
   - Example: Washing machine, car systems

### System View - Remember These:

1. **Resource Allocator**
   - OS = **Manager** of resources
   - Manages: CPU time, memory, storage, I/O
   - Makes allocation decisions

2. **Control Program**
   - OS = **Controller** of execution
   - Prevents **errors** and **misuse**
