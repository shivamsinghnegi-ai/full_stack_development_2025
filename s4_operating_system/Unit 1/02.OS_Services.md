## OS Services

Operating systems provide various services to users and programs:

### 1. Program Execution
- **Purpose**: Load and execute programs
- **Functions**:
  - Load program into memory
  - Initialize execution environment
  - Handle program termination
  - Clean up resources after execution

### 2. I/O Operations
- **Purpose**: Manage input/output operations
- **Functions**:
  - Read from keyboard, mouse, disk
  - Write to monitor, printer, disk
  - Hide hardware complexity from users
  - Provide uniform interface for all devices

### 3. File System Management
- **Purpose**: Organize and manage files
- **Functions**:
  - Create, delete, read, write files
  - Organize files in directories
  - Manage file permissions
  - Handle file storage on disk

**File Operations**:
- Create, delete, open, close
- Read, write, seek
- Get file attributes
- Set file permissions

### 4. Communication Services
- **Purpose**: Enable communication between processes
- **Types**:
  - **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: Communication between processes on same system
  - **Network Communication**: Communication between processes on different systems
- **Methods**:
  - Shared memory
  - Message passing
  - Pipes
  - Sockets

### 5. Error Detection and Handling
- **Purpose**: Detect and handle errors
- **Types of Errors**:
  - CPU errors (division by zero)
  - Memory errors (accessing invalid memory)
  - I/O errors (disk failure, network failure)
  - User errors (invalid input)

**Error Handling**:
- Detect errors
- Report errors to user
- Recover from errors when possible
- Prevent system crashes

### 6. Resource Allocation
- **Purpose**: Allocate system resources efficiently
- **Resources Managed**:
  - CPU time
  - Memory space
  - I/O devices
  - Storage space

**Allocation Strategies**:
- Fair distribution
- Priority-based allocation
- Resource scheduling

### 7. Accounting
- **Purpose**: Track resource usage
- **Information Tracked**:
  - CPU time used by each user
  - Memory used
  - I/O operations performed
  - Storage space used

**Uses**:
- Billing users
- System performance analysis
- Resource planning

### 8. Protection and Security
- **Purpose**: Protect system and user data
- **Protection Mechanisms**:
  - User authentication (login)
  - Access control (file permissions)
  - Data encryption
  - Firewall protection
  - Antivirus software

**Security Features**:
- User accounts and passwords
- File permissions (read, write, execute)
- Network security
- System updates and patches
