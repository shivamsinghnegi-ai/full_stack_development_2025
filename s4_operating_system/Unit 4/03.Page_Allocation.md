## Page Allocation

### Types of Page Allocation

#### 1. **Equal Allocation**
- Each process gets equal number of frames
- **Formula:** frames per process = Total frames / Number of processes

**Example:**
- 100 frames, 5 processes → Each gets 20 frames

**Drawback:** Doesn't consider process size requirements

#### 2. **Proportional Allocation**
- Frames allocated based on process size
- **Formula:** 
  ```
  Frames for process P = (Size of P / Total size of all processes) × Total frames
  ```

**Example:**
```
Process A = 10 KB, Process B = 127 KB
Total = 137 KB, Available frames = 64

Frames for A = (10/137) × 64 ≈ 5 frames
Frames for B = (127/137) × 64 ≈ 59 frames
```

### Allocation Policies

#### 1. **Local Replacement**
- Process can only replace its own pages
- Number of frames per process is fixed
- Performance of one process not affected by others

#### 2. **Global Replacement**
- Process can replace pages from any process
- Dynamic frame allocation
- Better overall throughput
- One process can affect others

### Minimum Number of Frames

- Each process must have **minimum number of frames**
- **Reason:** To ensure process can execute
- Depends on instruction set architecture
- Example: Instruction that references multiple memory locations
