## Multiprogramming with Fixed Partitions

### What is Multiprogramming?
- Multiple programs loaded in memory simultaneously
- CPU switches between programs to maximize utilization
- Requires memory to be divided into partitions

### Fixed Partition Scheme

**Concept:** Main memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions at system boot time.

**Types:**
1. **Equal-sized partitions:** All partitions have same size
2. **Unequal-sized partitions:** Different partition sizes

### Memory Allocation

```
|  Operating System  |  ← OS (always resident)
|-------------------|
|   Partition 1     |  ← Fixed size
|-------------------|
|   Partition 2     |
|-------------------|
|   Partition 3     |
|-------------------|
|   Partition 4     |
|-------------------|
```

### Partition Allocation Strategies

1. **One queue per partition**
   - Separate queue for each partition
   - Process assigned to smallest adequate partition

2. **Single queue for all partitions**
   - Common queue for all processes
   - Allocated to first available suitable partition

### Fragmentation Problems

#### 1. **Internal Fragmentation**
- **Definition:** Unused memory within an allocated partition
- **Cause:** Process size < Partition size
- **Example:** Partition = 4MB, Process = 3MB → Internal fragmentation = 1MB

#### 2. **External Fragmentation**
- **Definition:** Free memory scattered in small chunks (not contiguous)
- **Cause:** Processes of varying sizes loaded/removed
- **Result:** Total free memory sufficient but not contiguous

### Advantages & Disadvantages

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Simple to implement | Internal fragmentation |
| Low overhead | Fixed number of processes |
| Easy memory protection | Inefficient memory utilization |
