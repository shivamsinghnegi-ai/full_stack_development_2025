# Features of Unix/Linux

1. **Multi-user** — Multiple users can access and use the system at the same time without interfering with each other.

2. **Multitasking** — Multiple processes/programs can run simultaneously on the system.

3. **Portability** — Written in C language, Unix/Linux can run on different types of hardware with minimal changes.

4. **Security** — Provides strong security through file permissions (read/write/execute), password protection, and user authentication.

5. **Open Source (Linux)** — The source code is freely available. Anyone can view, modify, and distribute it.

6. **Hierarchical File System** — Files and directories are organized in a tree structure starting from the root `/`, making it easy to manage.

7. **Shell Scripting Support** — Supports writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks and batch processing.

8. **Networking Support** — Has built-in support for networking protocols like TCP/IP, FTP, SSH, making it ideal for servers.

9. **Stability & Reliability** — Unix/Linux systems rarely crash and can run continuously for months or years without restarting.

10. **Case Sensitivity** — File names are case-sensitive. `File.txt` and `file.txt` are treated as two different files.
