# Introduction to Linux & Its File Structure

### What is Linux?
- Linux is a **free, open-source** operating system created by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991**.
- It is **Unix-like** — inspired by Unix but written from scratch.
- Linux = **Kernel** (just the core). Full OS = Linux + GNU tools = **GNU/Linux**.

### Unix vs Linux — Key Differences

| Feature | Unix | Linux |
|---------|------|-------|
| Cost | Paid (mostly) | Free & Open Source |
| Developer | AT&T Bell Labs | Linus Torvalds |
| Year | 1969 | 1991 |
| Source Code | Closed (mostly) | Open |
| Examples | macOS, Solaris, HP-UX | Ubuntu, RedHat, Kali |
| Portability | Less portable | Highly portable |

### Popular Linux Distributions
- **Ubuntu** — Beginner friendly
- **Kali Linux** — Cybersecurity
- **Red Hat** — Enterprise use
- **CentOS, Fedora, Debian**

### Linux File Structure
Linux follows **FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)** — same as Unix.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `/bin` | Basic commands |
| `/boot` | Boot loader files |
| `/home` | User personal files |
| `/lib` | Shared libraries |
| `/media` | Removable media (USB, CD) |
| `/mnt` | Temporarily mounted drives |
| `/proc` | Process information (virtual) |
| `/root` | Root user's home |
