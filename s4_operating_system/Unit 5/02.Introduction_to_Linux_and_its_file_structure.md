# Introduction to Linux & Its File Structure

### What is Linux?
- Linux is a **free, open-source** operating system created by **Linus Torvalds** in **1991**.
- It is **Unix-like** — inspired by Unix but written completely from scratch.
- Linux is just the **Kernel**. Full OS = Linux Kernel + GNU Tools = **GNU/Linux**.
- It is the most popular OS for servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems.

### Popular Linux Distributions

### Unix vs Linux — Key Differences

| Feature | Unix | Linux |

### Linux File Structure
Linux follows **FHS — Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**, same tree structure as Unix.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `/bin` | Basic user commands |
| `/boot` | Boot loader files |
| `/home` | User personal files |
| `/lib` | Shared system libraries |
| `/media` | Removable media (USB, CD) |
