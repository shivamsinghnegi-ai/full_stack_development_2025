# Introduction to Unix & Its File System

### What is Unix?
- Unix is a **multi-user, multitasking operating system** developed at **Bell Labs (AT&T)** in **1969** by **Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie**.
- Written in **C language** — making it portable across different hardware.
- It is the **base/parent OS** of many modern operating systems including Linux and macOS.

### Unix Architecture
```
+-----------------------------+
|        User / Shell         |  ← User gives commands here
+-----------------------------+
|           Kernel            |  ← Core — manages hardware & resources
+-----------------------------+
|          Hardware           |  ← Physical machine
+-----------------------------+
```
- **Shell** → Acts as interface between user and kernel. Interprets user commands.
- **Kernel** → Heart of Unix. Manages memory, CPU, processes, and files.

### Unix File System Hierarchy
> Key Concept: **"Everything in Unix is treated as a file."**

Files are organized in a **tree structure** starting from root `/`.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/` | Root — topmost directory of the entire system |
| `/bin` | Essential binary commands (ls, cp, mv, rm) |
| `/etc` | System configuration files |
| `/home` | Personal directories of users |
| `/usr` | User programs and utilities |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (cleared on reboot) |
| `/var` | Variable data like log files |
| `/dev` | Device files (keyboard, disk, etc.) |
| `/root` | Home directory of the root (admin) user |
