# Introduction to Unix & Its File System

### What is Unix?
- Unix is a **multi-user, multitasking operating system** developed at **Bell Labs (AT&T)** in **1969** by **Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie**.
- Written in **C language** — making it portable.
- It is the **base/parent** of many modern OS including Linux, macOS.

### Unix Architecture (3 Layers)
```
+-----------------------------+
|        User / Shell         |  ← User interacts here
+-----------------------------+
|           Kernel            |  ← Core of OS (manages hardware)
+-----------------------------+
|          Hardware           |  ← Physical machine
+-----------------------------+
```
- **Shell** → Interface between user and kernel. Takes user commands and passes to kernel.
- **Kernel** → Heart of Unix. Manages memory, processes, files, devices.

### Unix File System Hierarchy
Everything in Unix is treated as a **file**.

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/` | Root — topmost directory |
| `/bin` | Essential commands (ls, cp, mv) |
| `/etc` | Configuration files |
| `/home` | User home directories |
| `/usr` | User programs & utilities |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/var` | Variable data (logs) |
| `/dev` | Device files |
| `/root` | Home directory of root user |
