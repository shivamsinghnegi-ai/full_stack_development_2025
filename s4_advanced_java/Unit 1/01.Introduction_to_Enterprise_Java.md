# Introduction to Enterprise Java

### What is Enterprise Java?

**Enterprise Java** refers to the Java platform designed for developing large-scale, distributed, multi-tier enterprise applications. These applications typically require:
- High performance and scalability
- Security
- Reliability
- Transaction management
- Database connectivity

### Key Characteristics

#### 1. **Multi-tier Architecture**
- **Presentation Tier**: User interface (Web browsers, mobile apps)
- **Business Logic Tier**: Processing and business rules
- **Data Tier**: Database and data storage

#### 2. **Distributed Computing**
- Components can run on different machines
- Communication through networks
- Load balancing across multiple servers

#### 3. **Scalability**
- Can handle increasing number of users
- Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)
- Vertical scaling (upgrading existing servers)

### Why Enterprise Java?

- **Platform Independence**: "Write Once, Run Anywhere"  
- **Robust and Secure**: Built-in security features  
- **Scalable**: Can grow with business needs  
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Vast libraries and frameworks  
- **Community Support**: Large developer community  

### Enterprise Application Examples

- **E-commerce websites** (Amazon, Flipkart)
- **Banking systems** (Online banking, ATM networks)
- **Healthcare management systems**
- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems**
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems**
