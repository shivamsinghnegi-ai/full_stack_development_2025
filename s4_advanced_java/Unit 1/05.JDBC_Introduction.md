## What is JDBC ?
- JDBC is an API that helps applications to communicate with databases. 
- It allows Java programs to connect to a database, run queries, retrieve and manipulate data. 
- Because of JDBC, Java applications can easily work with different relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and more.

## JDBC Driver Types

### Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
- **Purana driver hai** (old driver)
- Written in C language
- **Performance issues** - extra layers slow down execution
- **Scalability issues** - can't handle many concurrent users
- **We don't use this**

### Type 2: Native-API Driver
- Provided by **database vendors** (MySQL, Oracle, IBM, PostgreSQL)
- Database vendors provide these so anyone can store data
- Better than Type 1 but requires native libraries

### Type 3: Network Protocol Driver
- Uses **middleware** (intermediary layer)
- Middleware converts native API calls to DB calls
- Good but not most efficient
- "Jab aap kuch bhi extra thing use karoge (middleware in this case) to kuch na kuch resource use karega"

### Type 4: Thin Driver 
- **We use this - Best option**
- Directly converts native API calls to DB calls
- No extra layers, most efficient

## JDBC Components

### DriverManager Class
- Has many methods, one is `getConnection()`
- Used to connect with database
- Returns `Connection` interface instance

### Connection Interface
- Store the database connection
- Instance created to hold connection

### Statement and PreparedStatement Interfaces
- Used to run SQL queries
- PreparedStatement is more secure and efficient

### ResultSet Interface
- SQL query run karne ke baad jo data aata hai, tables ke form mein hota hai
- Holds the table data coming from database

## Program Flow

```
Step 1: Connect IDE with Database
         ↓
Step 2: Load Necessary Drivers
         ↓
Step 3: Create Connection
         ↓
Step 4: Create Statement
         ↓
Step 5: Execute Query
```


1. **Connect IDE with Database** - Add necessary connector
2. **Load Necessary Drivers** - `Class.forName()`
3. **Create Connection** - `DriverManager.getConnection()`
4. **Create Statement** - `connection.createStatement()` or `prepareStatement()`
5. **Execute Query** - Run SQL commands
