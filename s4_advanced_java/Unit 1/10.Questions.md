# UNIT 1: Foundations of Enterprise Java & JDBC

1. Define Enterprise Java. How is it different from Core Java?

2. What is MVC architecture? Explain its components (Model, View, Controller) with a neat labeled diagram.

3. Trace the evolution of Enterprise Java from J2EE to Jakarta EE and Spring ecosystem. Discuss the limitations of EJBs and how Spring addressed them.

4. Compare Model 1 and Model 2 architectures with diagrams. What are the advantages of Model 2?

5. What is JDBC? Explain the JDBC architecture with a diagram showing JDBC API, Driver API, and Driver Manager.

6. List and explain the four types of JDBC drivers (Type-1, Type-2, Type-3, Type-4) with their advantages and disadvantages.

7. Explain the step-by-step process of connecting a Java application to a database using JDBC with code snippets for each step.

8. What is the purpose of `Class.forName()` method in JDBC? What happens if the driver class is not found?

9. Explain the role of `DriverManager` class. How does `getConnection()` method work?

10. What is `Connection` interface? List and explain its important methods.

11. Differentiate between `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement` with examples of when to use each.

12. What is SQL Injection? How does `PreparedStatement` prevent it? Illustrate with an example.

13. Explain the `execute()`, `executeQuery()`, and `executeUpdate()` methods with their return types and use cases.

14. What is `ResultSet`? Explain its different types (TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE) and concurrency modes.

15. What is `ResultSetMetaData`? Write a program to display column names and data types of a table.

16. What is `DatabaseMetaData`? Explain its usage with code to display database product name and driver version.

17. Explain Transaction Management in JDBC. How do `setAutoCommit()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods work?

18. What is Batch Processing in JDBC? Write a program to insert multiple records using batch update.

19. Differentiate between JDBC and ODBC.

20. What are the limitations of JDBC? How are they addressed in modern frameworks like JPA/Hibernate?

21. What is the role of Web Container in Enterprise Java? Name two examples.

22. What is a Deployment Descriptor? Explain the role of `web.xml` file.

23. Explain the request-response cycle in an MVC-based web application.

24. What is Dependency Injection? How does Spring Framework implement it?

25. **Program:** Write a JDBC program to insert a student record (RollNo, Name, Marks) using `PreparedStatement`.

26. **Program:** Write a JDBC program to display all records from Employee table where Salary > 50000.

27. **Program:** Write a JDBC program to update the price of a product based on ProductID.

28. **Program:** Write a JDBC program to delete a record from Customer table using `PreparedStatement`.

29. **Program:** Write a JDBC program demonstrating transaction management - insert records in two tables with rollback on failure.

30. **Program:** Write a JDBC program to call a stored procedure using `CallableStatement`.
