# UNIT 2: Java Servlets and Web Application Basics

1. What is a Servlet? How is it different from an Applet and CGI?

2. Explain the Servlet API. Draw the hierarchy showing `Servlet` interface, `GenericServlet` class, and `HttpServlet` class.

3. Describe the HTTP Request-Response model in Servlets with a diagram.

4. Explain the Servlet Lifecycle in detail with a diagram. Describe the role of `init()`, `service()`, and `destroy()` methods.

5. What is the role of Servlet Container (Web Container) in managing servlet instances and threads?

6. Differentiate between `GenericServlet` and `HttpServlet`. When would you use each?

7. What are Initialization Parameters? Explain how to configure and access servlet-specific init params and context params in `web.xml`.

8. Explain the `load-on-startup` element in `web.xml`. What values can it take?

9. Differentiate between `ServletConfig` and `ServletContext` with examples.

10. Explain the important methods of `HttpServletRequest` interface with examples.

11. Explain the important methods of `HttpServletResponse` interface with examples.

12. How do you handle form data in Servlets? Explain with GET and POST examples.

13. Differentiate between GET and POST HTTP methods. Which is more secure and why?

14. What is `RequestDispatcher`? Explain the difference between `forward()` and `include()` methods with examples.

15. Compare `forward()` and `sendRedirect()` methods. When would you use each?

16. What is Session Management? Why is it needed in web applications?

17. Explain Cookies as a session tracking mechanism. How do you create, send, and read cookies?

18. What is the difference between Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies?

19. Explain the `HttpSession` interface. Describe methods like `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`, `getId()`, `invalidate()`.

20. What is URL Rewriting? When is it used? Explain with an example.

21. Compare Cookies, URL Rewriting, Hidden Form Fields, and HttpSession as session tracking techniques.

22. What are Servlet Filters? Explain their purpose and real-world applications.

23. Explain the Filter lifecycle with `init()`, `doFilter()`, and `destroy()` methods.

24. What is `FilterChain`? How does filter chaining work?

25. What is `FilterConfig`? How is it used to access filter initialization parameters?

26. How do you configure a Filter in `web.xml`? Explain `<filter>` and `<filter-mapping>` elements.

27. Explain HTTP status codes commonly used in Servlets: 200, 302, 400, 404, 500.

28. Compare Servlets and JSP. When would you use each? How do they work together in MVC?

29. What are annotations in Servlet 3.0? How do `@WebServlet` and `@WebFilter` simplify development?

30. Explain error and exception handling in Servlets using `web.xml` configuration.

31. **Program:** Write a Servlet that displays "Welcome to Rai University" with `web.xml` configuration.

32. **Program:** Write a Servlet to read username and password from a login form. Display success or failure message.

33. **Program:** Write an HTML form and Servlet to accept and display student details (Name, Email, Course).

34. **Program:** Write a Servlet demonstrating the use of initialization parameters configured in `web.xml`.

35. **Program:** Write a program using `RequestDispatcher` to forward request from FirstServlet to SecondServlet.

36. **Program:** Write a Servlet that creates a persistent Cookie (expires in 24 hours) storing username.

37. **Program:** Write a Servlet that reads and displays all cookies sent by the client.

38. **Program:** Implement a Session Counter - a servlet that counts how many times a user has visited the page in current session.

39. **Program:** Write a complete Login-Logout application using `HttpSession` with LoginServlet, WelcomeServlet, and LogoutServlet.

40. **Program:** Write a Servlet demonstrating URL Rewriting using `encodeURL()` method.

41. **Program:** Write an Authentication Filter that checks if user is logged in before allowing access to /admin/* URLs. Redirect to login page if not authenticated.

42. **Program:** Write a Logging Filter that logs request URL, timestamp, and client IP address for all incoming requests.

43. **Program:** Write a Registration Servlet that accepts user data from a form and inserts it into database using JDBC.

44. **Program:** Write a Servlet to display all products from database in an HTML table format.

45. **Program:** Write a Servlet-based application to perform CRUD operations on an Employee table.
