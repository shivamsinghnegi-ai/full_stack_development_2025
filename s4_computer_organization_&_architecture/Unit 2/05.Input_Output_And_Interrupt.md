# Input-Output and Interrupts

## 1. Input-Output Configuration
**How do Input & Output devices communicate?**

The computer communicates with external devices (like Keyboard and Printer) through interfaces.

### Data Flow Components
*   **Input Device (Keyboard)**: Sends information to the Transmitter Interface.
*   **Transmitter Interface**: Sends information to the Input Register (**INPR**).
*   **INPR (Input Register)**: Holds the 8-bit alphanumeric input data.
*   **OUTR (Output Register)**: Holds the 8-bit data received from the Accumulator (**AC**).
*   **Receiver Interface**: Receives data from OUTR and sends it to the Output Device.
*   **Output Device (Printer)**: Prints the data.

### Control Flags (Handshaking)
To synchronize the speed difference between fast CPU and slow I/O devices, two flags are used:
*   **FGI (Input Flag)**: 1-bit control flip-flop.
    *   `FGI = 0`: Initially zero, meaning no information/data is ready.
    *   `FGI = 1`: Data is available in INPR.
*   **FGO (Output Flag)**: 1-bit control flip-flop.
    *   `FGO = 1`: Device is ready/free to accept new data.
    *   `FGO = 0`: Device is busy printing.

## 2. Interrupts

### Definition
An **Interrupt** is a mechanism by which modules like I/O or memory may interrupt the normal processing of the CPU.

### Why is it needed?
*   To improve the **processing efficiency** of the CPU.
*   Most external devices are much **slower** than the CPU.
*   Without interrupts, the CPU would waste a lot of time **waiting** for these external devices to match up with CPU speed.

## 3. Comparison: With vs. Without Interrupts

### Without Interrupts (Programmed I/O)
*   **Process**:
    1.  CPU instructs printer to print.
    2.  When printer is active, CPU **waits** for the task to complete.
    3.  CPU performs **continuous checking** (polling) to find if the task is done.
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   Wastage of **Instruction Cycles**.
    *   Wastage of **CPU Time**.
    *   CPU cannot do other work while device is busy.

### With Interrupts
*   **Process**:
    1.  CPU instructs printer to print.
    2.  While printer does its task, CPU is **engaged in executing other instructions**.
    3.  User program proceeds **concurrently** with the printing task.
    4.  **When task is done**, the printer sends a signal (interrupt) to tell the CPU.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   Efficient use of CPU time.
    *   Parallel processing of I/O and computation.
