## 2. Functional Units

Every computer has **5 main parts** (functional units). Think of it like the human body!

### **A. Input Unit**
- **Job:** Takes information FROM you
- **Human Analogy:** Your EYES and EARS (receive information)
- **Examples:**
  - Keyboard (you type)
  - Mouse (you click)
  - Microphone (you speak)
  - Camera (takes pictures)
  - Scanner

**Simple Rule:** Anything that SENDS data TO the computer = Input device

---

### **B. Output Unit**
- **Job:** Shows results TO you
- **Human Analogy:** Your MOUTH (gives information)
- **Examples:**
  - Monitor/Screen (shows pictures, text)
  - Printer (prints on paper)
  - Speakers (makes sound)
  - Headphones

**Simple Rule:** Anything that computer SENDS data to YOU = Output device

---

### **C. Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
- **Job:** The BRAIN of the computer
- **Human Analogy:** Your BRAIN (thinks and decides)
- **Does:** All calculations and decision-making

The CPU has **2 parts:**

#### **i. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
- **Job:** Does ALL math operations
- **Does:**
  - Addition: 5 + 3 = 8
  - Subtraction: 10 - 2 = 8
  - Multiplication: 4 × 2 = 8
  - Division: 16 ÷ 2 = 8
  - Comparisons: Is 5 > 3? (YES)
- **Analogy:** Like a calculator inside the brain

#### **ii. Control Unit (CU)**
- **Job:** The BOSS - controls everything
- **Does:**
  - Tells other units what to do
  - Manages data flow
  - Controls timing
  - Coordinates all activities
- **Analogy:** Like a traffic police officer directing traffic

---

### **D. Memory Unit**
- **Job:** STORES information
- **Human Analogy:** Your MEMORY (remembers things)

Memory has **2 types:**

#### **i. Primary Memory (Main Memory - RAM)**
- **Speed:** VERY FAST
- **Size:** Small (8GB, 16GB)
- **Temporary:** Data deleted when power OFF
- **Example:** RAM (Random Access Memory)
- **Analogy:** Your short-term memory (remember what you had for breakfast today)

#### **ii. Secondary Memory (Storage)**
- **Speed:** Slower
- **Size:** HUGE (500GB, 1TB)
- **Permanent:** Data stays even when power OFF
- **Example:** Hard Disk, SSD, USB drive, CD
- **Analogy:** Your long-term memory (remember your childhood)

---

### **E. Registers**
- **Job:** SUPER FAST temporary storage inside CPU
- **Size:** VERY SMALL (few bytes)
- **Speed:** FASTEST memory
- **Purpose:** Hold data that CPU is currently using
- **Analogy:** Your hand holding a pen while writing (immediate access)

---

### How They All Work Together

```
YOU → [INPUT] → [MEMORY] → [CPU] → [MEMORY] → [OUTPUT] → YOU
      Keyboard    RAM        Brain      RAM      Screen
```

**Example:** Playing a video game
1. **INPUT:** You press arrow key (move right)
2. **MEMORY:** Stores the instruction
3. **CPU:** Processes "move character right"
4. **MEMORY:** Stores new character position
5. **OUTPUT:** Screen shows character moved right

## Operations & Architecture

## 3. Basic Operational Concepts

### How Does a Computer Actually Work?

The computer follows a simple **3-step cycle** for EVERY instruction:

### **The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle** (FDE Cycle)

Think of it like following a recipe!

#### **Step 1: FETCH**
- **What happens:** Get the next instruction from memory
- **Like:** Taking a recipe card from the recipe box
- **Example:** Instruction says "ADD 5 + 3"

#### **Step 2: DECODE**
- **What happens:** Understand what the instruction means
- **Like:** Reading the recipe and understanding what to do
- **Example:** CPU understands it needs to do addition

#### **Step 3: EXECUTE**
- **What happens:** Actually DO the instruction
- **Like:** Actually cooking according to the recipe
- **Example:** ALU adds 5 + 3 = 8

Then the cycle **REPEATS** for the next instruction!

```
FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → FETCH → DECODE → EXECUTE → ...
(forever until program ends)
```

---

### **Interrupts**

- **What it is:** An EMERGENCY signal that stops current work
- **Why needed:** Something urgent needs attention RIGHT NOW
- **Like:** Fire alarm during class - you stop studying and evacuate
- **Example:** 
  - Pressing CTRL+C to stop a program
  - Printer out of paper (needs attention NOW)
  - Error message popup

**How it works:**
1. Computer doing normal work
2. INTERRUPT happens!
3. Computer PAUSES current work
4. Handles the interrupt (urgent task)
5. RESUMES normal work from where it stopped

---

## 4. Bus Structures

### What is a Bus?

A **bus** is like a highway inside the computer where data travels!

**NOT a vehicle!** In computers, BUS = **pathway for electrical signals**

### Three Types of Buses:

#### **A. Data Bus**
- **Job:** Carries ACTUAL DATA (numbers, letters, pictures)
- **Direction:** Two-way (↔) - data can go back and forth
- **Example:** Moving the number "5" from memory to CPU
- **Analogy:** Highway carrying cars (data)
- **Width:** 32-bit or 64-bit (wider = more data at once)

#### **B. Address Bus** 
- **Job:** Carries ADDRESSES (locations in memory)
- **Direction:** One-way (→) - only CPU to memory
- **Example:** CPU says "get data from memory location 1234"
- **Analogy:** GPS coordinates telling where to go
- **Width:** 32-bit can address 4GB memory

#### **C. Control Bus** 
- **Job:** Carries CONTROL SIGNALS (commands/instructions)
- **Direction:** Both ways (↔)
- **Example:** "READ from memory" or "WRITE to memory"
- **Analogy:** Traffic signals (stop, go, turn)

---

### How Buses Work Together

**Example:** CPU wants to read data from memory location 100

```
1. ADDRESS BUS → Sends address "100" to memory
2. CONTROL BUS → Sends "READ" signal
3. Memory finds location 100
4. DATA BUS → Brings the data back to CPU
```

**Like ordering pizza:**
1. Address Bus = Telling the pizza place your home address
2. Control Bus = Saying "DELIVER" (the command)
3. Data Bus = Pizza arriving at your door (the actual data)

---

### Bus Organization Types

#### **Single Bus Structure** 
- **What:** ONE bus connects everything
- **Advantage:** Simple, cheap
- **Disadvantage:** Slow (only one device can use at a time)
- **Like:** One-lane road - traffic jams!

#### **Multiple Bus Structure** 
- **What:** MULTIPLE buses for different purposes
- **Advantage:** Fast (many devices can work simultaneously)
- **Disadvantage:** Complex, expensive
- **Like:** Multi-lane highway - smooth traffic!

---

## 5. Software

### What is Software?

**Software = Programs and instructions that tell hardware what to do**

**Hardware** (physical parts) is useless without **Software** (instructions)!

**Analogy:** 
- Hardware = Your body
- Software = Your knowledge/skills

### Two Types of Software:

#### **A. System Software**
- **Job:** Manages and controls the computer itself
- **User:** Computer uses it (you don't directly interact)
- **Examples:**
  - **Operating System (OS):** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android
  - **Drivers:** Help OS talk to printer, mouse, etc.
  - **Utility programs:** Antivirus, disk cleaner

**Like:** The manager of a restaurant (organizes everything)

#### **B. Application Software**
- **Job:** Helps YOU do specific tasks
- **User:** YOU use it directly
- **Examples:**
  - Microsoft Word (write documents)
  - Chrome (browse internet)
  - Photoshop (edit photos)
  - Games

**Like:** The food in a restaurant (what you actually consume)

---

### Important System Software Components:

#### **i. Operating System (OS)**
- **Job:** The KING of software - controls everything
- **Does:**
  - Manages memory
  - Runs programs
  - Handles files
  - Controls hardware
- **Examples:** Windows 11, macOS, Linux

#### **ii. Compiler**
- **Job:** Translates human code to machine code
- **Input:** High-level code (Python, Java - you can read)
- **Output:** Machine code (0s and 1s - computer can read)
- **Translates:** ENTIRE program at once
- **Like:** Translating a whole book from English to Chinese

#### **iii. Interpreter**
- **Job:** Translates AND executes code line-by-line
- **Input:** High-level code
- **Output:** Executes immediately
- **Translates:** ONE LINE at a time
- **Like:** A live translator at a conference

#### **iv. Assembler**
- **Job:** Converts assembly language to machine code
- **Input:** Assembly code (ADD, SUB, MOV)
- **Output:** Binary code (010101)
- **Like:** Converting shorthand notes to full sentences

## 6. Performance

### How Do We Measure Computer Speed?

#### **A. Clock Speed**
- **What:** How many operations per second
- **Unit:** Hertz (Hz)
  - 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second
- **Example:** 3.5 GHz processor
- **Like:** Heart beats per minute (faster = more work done)

**Higher clock speed = Faster computer** (usually)

#### **B. CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)**
- **What:** How many clock cycles needed for one instruction
- **Lower is better!**
- **Example:** CPI = 2 means each instruction takes 2 clock cycles
- **Like:** Steps needed to complete one task

#### **C. MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second)**
- **What:** How many instructions executed per second
- **Higher is better!**
- **Formula:** 
  ```
  MIPS = Clock Speed (MHz) / (CPI × 1 million)
  ```
- **Example:** 100 MIPS = 100 million instructions per second
- **Like:** Tasks completed per hour

---

### Performance Formula

```
Execution Time = Number of Instructions × CPI × Clock Cycle Time
```

**To make computer faster:**
1. Reduce number of instructions (better programming)
2. Reduce CPI (better CPU design)
3. Increase clock speed (better hardware)

---

## 7. Multiprocessors and Multicomputers

### Single vs Multiple Processors

#### **Traditional Computer (Single Processor)**
- **Has:** ONE CPU
- **Does:** ONE task at a time (sequentially)
- **Like:** One chef cooking - slow

#### **Modern Computer (Multiple Processors)**
- **Has:** MANY CPUs
- **Does:** MANY tasks simultaneously (parallel)
- **Like:** Many chefs cooking together - fast!

---

### **A. Multiprocessor System**

- **What:** Multiple CPUs in ONE computer
- **Memory:** SHARED (all CPUs use same memory)
- **Communication:** Fast (CPUs talk through shared memory)
- **Example:** Your laptop with 8 cores (8 mini-CPUs)
- **Advantage:** Fast, cheap
- **Like:** Team working on one whiteboard together

```
CPU 1 ↘
CPU 2 → SHARED MEMORY
CPU 3 ↗
```

---

### **B. Multicomputer System**

- **What:** Multiple SEPARATE computers connected
- **Memory:** DISTRIBUTED (each computer has own memory)
- **Communication:** Slow (computers talk through network)
- **Example:** Google's data centers (thousands of computers)
- **Advantage:** Can add more computers easily
- **Like:** Team members working from different offices

```
Computer 1 (Memory 1) ↘
Computer 2 (Memory 2) → NETWORK
Computer 3 (Memory 3) ↗
```
