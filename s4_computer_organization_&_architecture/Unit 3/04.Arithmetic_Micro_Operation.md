# Arithmetic Micro-Operations

### What are Micro-Operations?
Micro-operations are the **elementary operations** performed on data stored in registers during one clock pulse. They are the smallest unit of operations inside the CPU.

> **There are 4 types of micro-operations — **Arithmetic, Logic, Shift, and Register Transfer.** Class 2 covers the first three in depth.**

### List of Arithmetic Micro-Operations

| Operation | Symbolic Notation | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Addition | `R3 ← R1 + R2` | Add R1 and R2 |
| Subtraction | `R3 ← R1 - R2` | Subtract R2 from R1 |
| Increment | `R1 ← R1 + 1` | Add 1 to R1 |
| Decrement | `R1 ← R1 - 1` | Subtract 1 from R1 |
| Add with Carry | `R3 ← R1 + R2 + Cin` | Add with carry input |
| Subtract with Borrow | `R3 ← R1 - R2 - Bin` | Subtract with borrow |
| Transfer (Negate) | `R2 ← R̄2 + 1` | 2's complement of R2 |
| Negate and Add | `R3 ← R1 + R̄2 + 1` | R1 + 2's complement of R2 = R1 - R2 |

### Binary Adder (Hardware)

Used to implement addition micro-operation.

```
    A3  A2  A1  A0
    |   |   |   |
   [FA][FA][FA][FA]  ← Full Adders
    |   |   |   |
    S3  S2  S1  S0    Cout →
```

- **FA = Full Adder** — takes 3 inputs (A, B, Cin) and gives Sum and Cout
- Carry ripples from LSB to MSB → called **Ripple Carry Adder**

### Binary Adder-Subtractor

A single circuit that performs both addition and subtraction using a **mode input M** and **XOR gates**.

```
When M = 0 → Addition   : S = A + B
When M = 1 → Subtraction: S = A + B̄ + 1  (2's complement subtraction)
```

**How it works:**
- Each bit of B is XOR'd with M
- When M=0 → B passes unchanged → Addition
- When M=1 → B is inverted + M=1 fed as Cin → 2's complement subtraction

>  **The adder-subtractor uses **XOR gates** as programmable inverters. This is a very common diagram question.**

### Binary Incrementer

Adds 1 to the contents of a register.

```
R ← R + 1
```

Uses **half adders** in a chain. The Cin of the first half adder is hardwired to 1.

### Arithmetic Circuit (Full)

A general arithmetic circuit that performs multiple arithmetic operations based on selection inputs **S1, S0** and carry input **Cin**.

| S1 | S0 | Cin | Operation | Function |
|----|----|-----|-----------|----------|
| 0  | 0  | 0   | D = A     | Transfer A |
| 0  | 0  | 1   | D = A + 1 | Increment A |
| 0  | 1  | 0   | D = A + B | Addition |
| 0  | 1  | 1   | D = A + B + 1 | Add with carry |
| 1  | 0  | 0   | D = A + B̄ | Subtract with borrow |
| 1  | 0  | 1   | D = A + B̄ + 1 | Subtraction (A - B) |
| 1  | 1  | 0   | D = A - 1 | Decrement A |
| 1  | 1  | 1   | D = A     | Transfer A |
