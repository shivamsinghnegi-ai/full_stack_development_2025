# Register Transfer Language (RTL)

### What is RTL?
Register Transfer Language is a **symbolic notation** used to describe the movement of data between registers and the micro-operations performed on that data.

> **RTL is not a programming language — it is a **notation/language to describe hardware operations** at the micro-level.**

### Key Symbols in RTL

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `R1, R2` | Registers | R1 holds data |
| `←` | Transfer (assignment) | `R1 ← R2` (copy R2 into R1) |
| `,` | Simultaneous operations | `R1 ← R2, R2 ← R1` |
| `[ ]` | Memory address | `M[AR]` = Memory at address in AR |
| `( )` | Contents of | `(R1)` = contents of R1 |
| `↑` or `∧` | AND operation | `R1 ← R1 ∧ R2` |
| `∨` | OR operation | `R1 ← R1 ∨ R2` |
| `⊕` | XOR operation | `R1 ← R1 ⊕ R2` |
| `P:` | Control condition | `P: R2 ← R1` |

### Conditional Register Transfer

Syntax:
```
If (P = 1) then (R2 ← R1)
```
Written in RTL as:
```
P: R2 ← R1
```

- `P` is a **control signal** (a Boolean condition)
- The transfer happens **only when P = 1**
- Hardware implementation requires a **control gate (multiplexer or AND gate)**

**Example:**
```
K1: R2 ← R1
```
→ If control signal K1 is 1, then transfer contents of R1 into R2.

### Simultaneous Transfer
```
T: R2 ← R1, R1 ← R2
```
Both transfers happen at the **same clock edge** (not sequential). Requires buffer/temp register internally.
