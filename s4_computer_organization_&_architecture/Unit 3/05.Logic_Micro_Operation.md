# Logic Micro-Operations

### What are Logic Micro-Operations?
Logic micro-operations perform **bit-wise Boolean operations** on the data stored in registers. They treat each bit independently.

### List of Logic Micro-Operations

| Operation | Symbolic Notation | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| AND | `R3 ← R1 ∧ R2` | Bit-wise AND |
| OR | `R3 ← R1 ∨ R2` | Bit-wise OR |
| XOR | `R3 ← R1 ⊕ R2` | Bit-wise XOR (Exclusive OR) |
| NOT (Complement) | `R2 ← R̄1` | Bit-wise complement |
| Clear | `R ← 0000` | All bits set to 0 |
| Set | `R ← 1111` | All bits set to 1 |

### Applications of Logic Micro-Operations

#### 1. Selective Complement (using XOR)
XOR a register with a **mask** to flip specific bits.

```
R ← R ⊕ Mask
```
- Where Mask bit = 1 → corresponding bit in R is **flipped**
- Where Mask bit = 0 → corresponding bit in R is **unchanged**

**Example:**
```
R    =  1010 0110
Mask =  0000 1111
Result: 1010 1001   ← lower 4 bits are complemented
```

---

#### 2. Selective Set (using OR)
OR a register with a mask to **force specific bits to 1**.

```
R ← R ∨ Mask
```
- Where Mask bit = 1 → corresponding bit in R becomes **1**
- Where Mask bit = 0 → bit remains **unchanged**

---

#### 3. Selective Clear (using AND)
AND a register with a mask to **force specific bits to 0**.

```
R ← R ∧ Mask
```
- Where Mask bit = 0 → corresponding bit in R becomes **0**
- Where Mask bit = 1 → bit remains **unchanged**

---

#### 4. Mask Operation (using AND)
Used to **clear specific bits** — same as selective clear.

```
R ← R ∧ 0000 1111   ← keeps only lower 4 bits, clears upper 4 bits
```

---

#### 5. Insert Operation (using OR after Masking)
Used to **insert a specific bit pattern** into a register:
1. First **mask** (AND) to clear the target bits
2. Then **OR** with the new pattern

---

#### 6. Clear Operation (using XOR)
XOR a register with **itself** to clear it:
```
R ← R ⊕ R = 0000   (all bits become 0)
```

>  **XOR with itself always gives 0. This is a trick used in assembly language to clear a register efficiently.**

### Logic Circuit (Full)

A 4-function logic circuit using selection inputs **S1, S0**:

| S1 | S0 | Operation | Output F |
|----|----|-----------|----------|
| 0  | 0  | AND       | F = A ∧ B |
| 0  | 1  | OR        | F = A ∨ B |
| 1  | 0  | XOR       | F = A ⊕ B |
| 1  | 1  | NOT       | F = Ā (complement of A) |

>  **This 4-function table is frequently asked. Note that NOT only uses A, not B.**
