# Register Transfer

### What is a Register?
A register is a **group of flip-flops** (each storing 1 bit), used to store n-bit data temporarily inside the CPU.

- **n-bit register** = n flip-flops
- **Common registers:** AR (Address Register), PC (Program Counter), DR (Data Register), AC (Accumulator), IR (Instruction Register)

### How Register Transfer Works

Data transfer between registers is controlled by:
1. **Clock pulse** — transfer happens on clock edge
2. **Control signal (load)** — enables the transfer

**Block Diagram — 4-bit Register Transfer:**
```
         Control Signal (Load)
               |
     __________|__________
    |                     |
 [R1: FF3 FF2 FF1 FF0] --→ [R2: FF3 FF2 FF1 FF0]
```

**RTL Notation:**
```
Load: R2 ← R1
```

### Hardware Implementation
- Uses **D Flip-Flops** with a **multiplexer** at the input
- MUX selects: either keep old value OR load new value from source register
- Controlled by the **load signal**

```
If Load = 0 → Q(t+1) = Q(t)   [no change]
If Load = 1 → Q(t+1) = Input  [transfer happens]
```

> **Always state that register transfers are **synchronous** (happen on clock pulse). This is a common MCQ trap.**
