# 10: SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS

*(How engineers actually choose in real systems)*

---

## 1. Why This Comparison Is Crucial

Most real-world systems **do not pick just one model**.
They mix **SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS** intentionally—service by service.

Senior engineers are expected to answer:

* Why this service is on PaaS?
* Why that workload stays on IaaS?
* Why some problems are solved by SaaS instead of building anything?

This article builds that **decision framework**.

---

## 2. One-Line Definition (Memory Anchor)

* **IaaS** → *“I want full control.”*
* **PaaS** → *“I want to deploy code fast.”*
* **SaaS** → *“I just want the outcome.”*

Everything else is a consequence of these choices.

## 3. Responsibility Comparison (The Core Difference)

Let’s slow this down and be explicit.

| Layer | Who Manages Infrastructure      | Who Manages App  |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| IaaS  | Provider (hardware)             | You (OS → App)   |
| PaaS  | Provider (infra + OS + runtime) | You (App only)   |
| SaaS  | Provider (everything)           | You (usage only) |

This table explains **why complexity shifts upward** as you go from IaaS → SaaS.

## 4. Decision Axis #1: Level of Control

### When Control Matters

Choose **IaaS** if you need:

* OS-level tuning
* custom networking
* specialized performance behavior

Example:

* Video encoding pipelines at **Netflix**
* Custom backend services at **Swiggy**

### When Control Slows You Down

Choose **PaaS** if:

* infra work adds no business value
* speed matters more than customization

## 5. Decision Axis #2: Speed of Delivery

* **IaaS** → slowest (setup + ops)
* **PaaS** → fast (push code)
* **SaaS** → instant (sign up)

### Real Product Reality

When a fintech feature must ship **before market opens**, teams don’t want to debug OS issues.
That’s why many APIs at **Groww** sit on PaaS.

## 6. Decision Axis #3: Operational Overhead

### IaaS

You handle:

* patching
* monitoring
* scaling logic
* failure recovery

### PaaS

Platform handles:

* restarts
* scaling
* health checks

### SaaS

No ops at all—only configuration.

This is why **small teams avoid IaaS initially**.

## 7. Decision Axis #4: Cost Behavior (Very Important)

* **IaaS**

  * cheapest at very large, predictable scale
  * expensive in manpower

* **PaaS**

  * higher per-unit cost
  * cheaper in engineering time

* **SaaS**

  * predictable subscription cost
  * cheapest for non-core functionality

Senior engineers optimize **total cost**, not cloud bills alone.

---

## 8. Decision Axis #5: Scalability Pattern

### Traffic Is Spiky?

* Live sports
* Flash sales
* Market open surges

→ **PaaS / SaaS-friendly**

Example: IPL streaming on **JioHotstar**

### Traffic Is Steady and Predictable?

* background processing
* internal analytics

→ **IaaS makes sense**

## 9. How Real Companies Mix All Three

Let’s look at a realistic composite architecture:

A consumer platform typically uses:

* **SaaS** → email, analytics, monitoring tools
* **PaaS** → APIs, user services, dashboards
* **IaaS** → heavy processing, legacy systems, custom workloads

This is **normal**, not an exception.

---

## 10. Common Mistakes Engineers Make

1. Choosing IaaS for everything “for flexibility”
2. Choosing SaaS for core logic and losing control
3. Ignoring long-term cost behavior
4. Designing without exit strategy (lock-in blindness)

Good architecture avoids extremes.

---

## 11. Senior Engineer’s Mental Model

Ask these questions:

* Is this my **core business logic**?
* Do I need **deep control** here?
* What happens at **10× scale**?
* What happens when **things fail**?
* Can we **move later if needed**?

Your answers decide the layer—not trends.

---

## Quick Recap

* IaaS = control + responsibility
* PaaS = speed + productivity
* SaaS = outcome + simplicity
* Real systems use all three
* Good choices are **context-driven**
