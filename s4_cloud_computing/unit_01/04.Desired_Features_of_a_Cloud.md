# 4: Desired Features of a Cloud

*(What actually makes a system “cloud-native” in the real world)*

---

## 1. Why “Features” Matter More Than Location

Putting an app on the internet does **not** make it cloud-based.

A system earns the “cloud” label only if it **behaves correctly under pressure**:

* sudden traffic spikes
* partial failures
* rapid growth
* cost constraints

These features define *how the system behaves*, not *where it runs*.

---

## 2. On-Demand Self-Service

### What it means

Resources (servers, storage, networking) can be:

* created
* resized
* deleted
  **instantly**, without provider-side human intervention.

### Real-World Example

During dinner hours, **Swiggy** sees a surge:

* new instances spin up automatically
* order services scale within minutes
* no tickets, no waiting

On-demand access turns traffic spikes into **routine events**, not emergencies.

---

## 3. Scalability (Ability to Handle Growth)

### What scalability means

The system can handle:

* more users
* more requests
* more data
  by **adding resources**, without redesign.

### Business Reality

When a delivery platform expands into new cities:

* user base grows
* restaurant count increases
* API traffic multiplies

Scalability ensures growth doesn’t become downtime.

---

## 4. Elasticity (Automatic Scale Up *and* Down)

Scalability answers *“Can we grow?”*
Elasticity answers *“Can we grow **and shrink automatically**?”*

### OTT Example

During an IPL final on **JioHotstar**:

* millions join simultaneously
* compute and bandwidth scale instantly
* after the match, resources scale down

Elasticity prevents **overpaying during idle hours**.

---

## 5. Resource Pooling (Multi-Tenancy)

### What it means

Cloud providers:

* pool massive resources
* serve many customers
* isolate workloads logically

### Streaming Insight

**Netflix** runs thousands of services:

* shared physical infrastructure
* strict isolation between workloads
* efficient usage across regions

Resource pooling is how cloud stays **cost-effective at scale**.

---

## 6. High Availability (Systems That Stay Up)

### What availability means

The application:

* continues serving users
* even when components fail

### Business Impact

For:

* payments
* food ordering
* streaming

Downtime directly affects **revenue and trust**.
High availability designs remove single points of failure.

---

## 7. Fault Tolerance (Designing for Failure)

Cloud systems assume:

> **Failures will happen**

So they are built to:

* detect failure
* isolate it
* recover automatically

### Senior-Level Insight

Strong systems don’t ask:

> “How do we prevent failure?”

They ask:

> “What happens *when* failure occurs?”

Cloud-native design embraces this mindset.

---

## 8. Measured Service (Pay-As-You-Go)

### What it means

Costs are based on:

* compute time
* storage used
* data transferred

### Fintech Example

On **Groww**:

* market open → heavy traffic → higher usage
* off-hours → minimal usage → lower cost

This pricing model enables **experimentation without massive upfront spend**.

---

## 9. Broad Network Access

Cloud services are accessible:

* over the internet
* from mobile and desktop
* across locations

This enables:

* remote work
* global products
* consistent user experience

It’s a foundation for modern digital businesses.

---

## 10. Why These Features Must Work Together

A system is truly cloud-based only when **all features operate together**:

* on-demand provisioning
* scalability + elasticity
* high availability
* fault tolerance
* usage-based pricing

Remove any one, and the system behaves like **traditional hosting**.

---

## Quick Recap

* Cloud is defined by **behavior**, not hosting
* Scalability ≠ Elasticity
* Failures are expected and handled
* Costs align with real usage
* These features enable modern large-scale platforms
