# 6: Cloud Infrastructure Management

*(What actually runs behind the scenes of the cloud)*

---

## 1. Why Infrastructure Management Matters

When you deploy an app to the cloud, it *feels* simple:

* push code
* get a URL
* handle users

But underneath, **massive infrastructure systems** are working continuously to keep your application:

* fast
* available
* secure
* cost-efficient

Understanding this layer is what separates a **developer who uses cloud** from an **engineer who designs systems**.

---

## 2. What “Cloud Infrastructure” Really Means

Cloud infrastructure is made up of three core building blocks:

1. **Compute** – where code runs
2. **Storage** – where data lives
3. **Networking** – how everything communicates

Infrastructure management is about:

* provisioning these resources
* monitoring them
* scaling them
* recovering from failures

---

## 3. Compute Infrastructure (Running Applications)

### What Compute Means in Cloud

Compute refers to:

* virtual machines
* containers
* managed runtimes

Anything that **executes your code** is compute.

### Real-World Example

When **Swiggy** processes:

* orders
* rider assignments
* payment callbacks

Each action runs on **compute instances** that:

* scale during dinner time
* scale down late night

Infrastructure management ensures compute is:

* always available
* never over-provisioned

## 4. Storage Infrastructure (Persisting Data)

### Types of Storage in Cloud

Cloud storage is not “one thing”.

It includes:

* block storage (VM disks)
* object storage (images, videos)
* databases (structured data)

### OTT Perspective

On **Netflix**:

* movies are stored as objects
* metadata is stored in databases
* logs and analytics are stored separately

Each storage type is optimized for **different access patterns**.

## 5. Networking Infrastructure (Connecting Everything)

### What Cloud Networking Handles

* request routing
* internal service communication
* public internet access
* security boundaries

### Why Networking Is Critical

If networking fails:

* services can’t talk
* APIs time out
* users see errors

Cloud infrastructure management ensures:

* low latency
* secure communication
* fault isolation

---

## 6. Load Balancing (Traffic Distribution)

Cloud systems rarely rely on one server.

Load balancers:

* distribute traffic across instances
* detect unhealthy servers
* reroute requests automatically

### Business Reality

During high traffic:

* no single server gets overloaded
* failures are invisible to users

Load balancing is **mandatory at scale**.

---

## 7. Monitoring and Observability

Infrastructure management is impossible without visibility.

Cloud platforms constantly monitor:

* CPU usage
* memory
* disk I/O
* network traffic
* error rates

### Fintech Example

On **Groww**:

* latency spikes during market volatility
* alerts trigger auto-scaling
* issues are detected before users complain

Monitoring turns **reactive systems into proactive ones**.

---

## 8. Automation: The Backbone of Cloud Management

Cloud infrastructure is not managed manually.

Automation handles:

* scaling rules
* instance replacement
* backups
* failover

### Key Insight

Without automation:

* cloud becomes expensive hosting
* human error increases
* scaling breaks

Automation is what makes cloud **reliable at global scale**.

## 9. Failure Handling and Self-Healing

Failures are expected:

* servers crash
* networks fail
* disks corrupt

Cloud systems respond by:

* detecting failures
* replacing instances
* rerouting traffic

This is called **self-healing infrastructure**.

Users should never know a failure happened.

---

## 10. Why Developers Should Care About Infrastructure Management

Even if you never touch servers directly:

* your API design affects scaling
* your database queries affect cost
* your deployment strategy affects availability

Senior engineers:

* understand infra behavior
* design apps that *work with* the cloud
* avoid accidental outages and cost explosions

---

## Quick Recap

* Cloud infrastructure = compute + storage + networking
* Load balancing distributes traffic safely
* Monitoring provides visibility
* Automation enables scale and reliability
* Self-healing handles failures without humans
