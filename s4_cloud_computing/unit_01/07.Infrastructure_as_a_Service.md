# 7: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

*(The deepest level of cloud control — explained properly)*

---

## 1. Why IaaS Exists (Before the Definition)

Cloud is not only about convenience — it’s about **choice**.

Some teams:

* want full control over the OS
* need custom security rules
* run specialized workloads
* cannot depend fully on managed platforms

For these cases, **IaaS exists**.

IaaS gives you cloud benefits **without giving up control**.

---

## 2. What Is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** provides **raw computing resources** over the internet:

* Virtual machines
* Storage
* Networking
* Firewalls and IPs

You are given the *building blocks*, not a finished setup.

> Think of IaaS as **renting empty land with electricity and water**, not a furnished house.

---

## 3. What You Get vs What You Manage (Very Important)

This is where most confusion happens, so let’s slow down.

### Cloud Provider Manages

* Physical servers
* Data centers
* Power, cooling
* Hardware failures

### You Manage

* Operating system (Linux / Windows)
* Runtime (Node, Java, Python)
* Application code
* Security patches
* Scaling logic (often manual)

This responsibility split defines **how much freedom and risk you take**.

## 4. Core Components of IaaS (Explained One by One)

### 4.1 Virtual Machines (VMs)

A **virtual machine** behaves like a real computer:

* its own OS
* its own CPU and RAM allocation
* its own disk

But it runs **on shared physical hardware**.

#### Why VMs Matter

* full OS control
* predictable performance
* suitable for legacy apps
* ideal for custom backend systems

---

### 4.2 Storage in IaaS

IaaS offers multiple storage types:

* **Block storage**
  VM disks, fast access, OS-level control

* **Object storage**
  Files, videos, logs, backups

Each serves a different purpose.

Using the wrong storage = performance issues + cost issues.

---

### 4.3 Networking in IaaS

Networking defines:

* how your VM talks to the internet
* how services talk internally
* how traffic is protected

Includes:

* private networks
* public IPs
* firewalls
* routing rules

Networking mistakes are a **top cause of outages and security breaches**.

## 5. Real-World Usage: Why Big Systems Still Use IaaS

### Food Delivery Systems

**Swiggy** uses IaaS for:

* internal tools
* backend services requiring OS-level tuning
* services with custom networking needs

They don’t use IaaS everywhere — only **where control matters**.

---

### OTT Platforms

**Netflix** relies on IaaS-like models for:

* streaming pipelines
* encoding systems
* regional traffic handling

These workloads need:

* performance predictability
* deep infrastructure control

---

## 6. How a MERN Backend Looks on IaaS (Step-by-Step)

Let’s slow this down clearly.

A MERN backend on IaaS usually involves:

1. Create a virtual machine
2. Install Linux
3. Configure firewall rules
4. Install Node.js
5. Deploy Express APIs
6. Connect MongoDB
7. Configure load balancer
8. Monitor CPU and memory
9. Manually scale or script scaling

This gives **maximum flexibility**, but also **maximum responsibility**.

---

## 7. Advantages of IaaS (With Reasoning)

### Full Control

* OS tuning
* custom libraries
* low-level debugging

### Predictable Environment

* fewer abstractions
* easier to reason about performance

### Legacy Compatibility

* older apps run without refactoring

---

## 8. Disadvantages of IaaS (Why It’s Not Always Chosen)

### Operational Overhead

* patching
* monitoring
* backups
* scaling logic

### Slower Development

* infra setup takes time
* mistakes are costly

### Requires Infra Knowledge

* networking
* security
* performance tuning

This is why many teams **start with PaaS**, then move to IaaS selectively.

---

## 9. When Should You Choose IaaS?

IaaS makes sense when:

* you need OS-level control
* performance tuning is critical
* compliance requires isolation
* workloads are custom or legacy

Senior engineers choose IaaS **deliberately**, not by default.

---

## 10. Mental Model to Remember IaaS

> IaaS = **Cloud power with self-responsibility**

You gain:

* freedom
* control

You accept:

* operational risk
* maintenance effort

---

## Quick Recap

* IaaS gives raw infrastructure
* You manage OS, runtime, security
* Best for custom, performance-sensitive systems
* Powerful but operationally heavy
* Used selectively in real-world systems
