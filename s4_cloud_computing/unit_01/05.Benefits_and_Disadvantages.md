# 5: Benefits and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

*(Why companies move to the cloud—and when they shouldn’t)*

---

## 1. Why This Article Matters

Cloud computing is powerful—but it is **not automatically the right choice** for every problem.

Senior engineers are expected to answer:

* *Why cloud here?*
* *Why not cloud there?*
* *What are the trade-offs?*

This article builds that **decision-making lens**.

---

## 2. Benefit 1: Reduced Upfront Cost (CapEx → OpEx)

### What changes

Traditional systems require:

* server purchases
* networking equipment
* data center space

Cloud replaces this with:

* pay-as-you-use pricing
* no hardware ownership

### Business Example

A startup like **Swiggy** did not begin by buying data centers.

* It started small
* Paid only for usage
* Scaled as demand increased

This model enables **fast experimentation**.

---

## 3. Benefit 2: Speed and Agility

### What cloud enables

* servers in minutes
* global deployment
* quick rollbacks
* rapid iteration

### OTT Example

When **Netflix** launches a new show:

* traffic patterns are unpredictable
* infrastructure must react instantly
* releases cannot be delayed by hardware limits

Cloud turns infrastructure into **software**, not procurement.

---

## 4. Benefit 3: Elastic Scalability

Cloud systems can:

* scale up during peaks
* scale down during idle times
* do both automatically

### Real-World Reality

For platforms with bursty traffic:

* food delivery
* live sports
* flash sales

Elasticity is not optional—it’s survival.

---

## 5. Benefit 4: High Availability and Reliability

Cloud providers design for:

* multi-zone redundancy
* automated failover
* continuous monitoring

### Why Businesses Care

Downtime means:

* lost revenue
* broken trust
* user churn

Cloud reduces downtime risk **without every company building its own infra team**.

---

## 6. Benefit 5: Focus on Core Business

Cloud removes the need to manage:

* physical servers
* OS patching
* hardware failures

Teams focus on:

* product features
* performance
* user experience

This is one of the **most underrated advantages**.

---

## 7. Disadvantage 1: Cost Can Grow Unpredictably

### The hard truth

Cloud is cheap to start—but can become expensive at scale.

### Fintech Example

On **Groww**:

* market volatility increases traffic
* APIs, databases, and analytics spike
* cloud bills can rise suddenly

Without cost monitoring, cloud becomes **financially dangerous**.

---

## 8. Disadvantage 2: Reduced Control

With cloud:

* you don’t control physical servers
* you depend on provider APIs
* outages are outside your hands

When a cloud region fails:

* your application may fail
* even if your code is perfect

This is a **shared risk model**.

---

## 9. Disadvantage 3: Vendor Lock-In

### What it means

* services are provider-specific
* moving away is costly
* architectures become tightly coupled

Examples:

* proprietary databases
* managed queues
* cloud-specific security models

Lock-in is not always bad—but must be **intentional**.

---

## 10. Disadvantage 4: Security Is Still Your Responsibility

A common myth:

> “Cloud provider handles security.”

Reality:

* provider secures infrastructure
* **you secure applications, data, access**

Misconfigurations cause:

* data leaks
* unauthorized access
* compliance violations

Cloud shifts responsibility—it doesn’t remove it.

---

## 11. When Cloud Is a Great Fit

Cloud is ideal when:

* traffic is unpredictable
* scale matters
* speed of delivery is critical
* global reach is needed

Startups, consumer platforms, and SaaS products fit naturally.

---

## 12. When Cloud May Not Be Ideal

Cloud may not be best when:

* workloads are constant and predictable
* latency must be ultra-low
* regulatory control is extreme
* costs are easier to manage on fixed infra

Hybrid or private models often make sense here.

---

## 13. Senior Engineer’s Takeaway

Cloud is not about:

* “modern vs old”
* “cloud vs non-cloud”

It’s about:

* **trade-offs**
* **context**
* **business goals**

Strong engineers choose cloud **for the right reasons**, not trends.

---

## Quick Recap

* Cloud reduces upfront cost but can increase operational cost
* It enables speed, scalability, and availability
* Control and predictability reduce
* Security and cost management remain critical
* Cloud decisions are architectural decisions
