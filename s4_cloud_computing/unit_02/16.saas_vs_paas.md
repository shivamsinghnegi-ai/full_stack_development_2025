# **16: SaaS vs PaaS — Architectural Decision Making**

*(Build it yourself, or use a platform?)*

---

## 1. Why This Decision Matters So Much

One of the **most important architectural decisions** engineers make is not about code or frameworks, but this:

> **Should we build this ourselves (PaaS), or should we use an existing product (SaaS)?**

This choice affects:

* development speed
* long-term cost
* flexibility
* operational risk
* team size and skill requirements

Many costly failures happen **not because of bad code**, but because the *wrong layer was chosen*.

---

## 2. First, Reframe the Question Properly

The real question is **not**:

* “Is SaaS better than PaaS?”
* “Is PaaS more powerful than SaaS?”

The real question is:

> **Is this functionality part of our core product, or just a supporting capability?**

This single distinction drives almost every correct decision.

---

## 3. What Choosing PaaS Actually Means

When you choose **PaaS**, you are saying:

* This logic is **core to our product**
* We need control over:

  * behavior
  * data model
  * evolution
* We are willing to:

  * write code
  * test thoroughly
  * operate and monitor it

### Typical PaaS Use Cases

* Backend APIs
* Recommendation engines
* Pricing logic
* Business workflows
* Domain-specific services

PaaS is about **building differentiated value**.

---

## 4. What Choosing SaaS Actually Means

When you choose **SaaS**, you are saying:

* This functionality is **not our competitive advantage**
* We value:

  * speed
  * reliability
  * reduced operational burden
* We are willing to:

  * adapt to the product
  * accept some limitations

### Typical SaaS Use Cases

* Email delivery
* Analytics and monitoring
* Authentication (often)
* CRM and internal tools
* Collaboration and productivity tools

SaaS is about **outsourcing complexity**.

## 5. The Core Trade-Off: Control vs Speed

This is the central tension.

| Aspect             | PaaS     | SaaS               |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------ |
| Control            | High     | Low                |
| Time to value      | Slower   | Fast               |
| Customization      | Deep     | Limited            |
| Operational effort | Required | Minimal            |
| Vendor lock-in     | Lower    | Higher             |
| Failure domain     | Yours    | Shared with vendor |

There is no “better” choice—only a **contextually correct one**.

---

## 6. A Practical Decision Framework (Step-by-Step)

Ask these questions **in order**:

### Step 1: Is this core business logic?

* Yes → lean toward **PaaS**
* No → lean toward **SaaS**

### Step 2: Will this logic change frequently?

* Yes → **PaaS** gives flexibility
* No → **SaaS** is safer

### Step 3: Can failure here stop our business?

* Yes → prefer **control (PaaS)**
* No → **SaaS** risk is acceptable

### Step 4: Do we have the team to operate it?

* Yes → PaaS is viable
* No → SaaS reduces risk

This framework alone prevents **most architectural mistakes**.

## 7. Realistic Architecture Pattern: Mixing SaaS and PaaS

In real systems, **both are used together**.

Typical pattern:

* Core domain logic → PaaS
* Supporting services → SaaS
* Data flows between both securely

This allows teams to:

* focus engineering effort where it matters
* avoid rebuilding solved problems

---

## 8. Common Mistakes Engineers Make

### Mistake 1: Building Everything on PaaS

Symptoms:

* slow delivery
* operational overload
* reinventing solved problems

### Mistake 2: Using SaaS for Core Logic

Symptoms:

* limited customization
* vendor dependency
* inability to differentiate

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Exit Costs

Both SaaS and PaaS choices must consider:

* data portability
* migration effort
* long-term flexibility

Good engineers always ask:

> “What if we need to change this in 2 years?”

---

## 9. Cost Thinking: Short-Term vs Long-Term

* **SaaS**

  * cheaper upfront
  * predictable pricing
  * can become expensive at scale

* **PaaS**

  * higher initial effort
  * engineering cost
  * more cost control long-term

Senior engineers evaluate **total cost of ownership**, not just monthly bills.

## 10. How This Fits into Unit 2

This article is a **decision bridge**:

* Before this: *how cloud services work*
* After this: *how applications are actually built and run*

It prepares you to understand:

* PaaS application frameworks
* SaaS system design
* cloud ecosystems

---

## 11. Mental Model to Remember

> **Use PaaS to build what makes you unique.
> Use SaaS to avoid rebuilding what doesn’t.**

This single sentence captures the entire article.

---

## Quick Recap

* SaaS vs PaaS is a strategic decision
* Core logic → PaaS
* Supporting functionality → SaaS
* Most systems use both
* Wrong choices create long-term pain
