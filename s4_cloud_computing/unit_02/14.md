# **14: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) — Architecture & Usage**

*(How IaaS fits into real cloud system designs)*

---

## 1. Why IaaS Reappears in Unit 2

In **Unit 1**, we answered:

> *What is IaaS?*

In **Unit 2**, we answer:

> *Where does IaaS sit inside an architecture, and why do teams still use it?*

This article is about **placement and usage**, not definitions.

---

## 2. Where IaaS Lives in the Cloud Stack

IaaS sits **above virtualization** and **below platforms**.

What this means architecturally:

* You get **virtual machines and networks**
* You decide **how applications are deployed**
* You are responsible for **OS-level behavior**

IaaS is the **lowest layer engineers directly interact with**.

---

## 3. Core Building Blocks of an IaaS Architecture

An IaaS-based system is composed of a few repeatable blocks.

### 3.1 Virtual Machines (Compute Nodes)

Virtual machines:

* run a full operating system
* have fixed CPU and memory
* behave like traditional servers

They are:

* predictable
* flexible
* long-lived (compared to PaaS instances)

This makes them suitable for:

* custom backends
* legacy systems
* specialized processing

---

### 3.2 Networking Layer

Every IaaS setup includes:

* private networks
* subnets
* routing rules
* firewalls

Architectural insight:

> In IaaS, **network design becomes part of application design**.

Poor networking choices cause:

* latency issues
* security exposure
* scaling bottlenecks

---

### 3.3 Storage Layer

IaaS storage typically includes:

* block storage (VM disks)
* object storage (files, backups)
* network-attached storage (shared data)

Architectural rule:

* OS + databases → block storage
* media, logs, backups → object storage

Using the wrong storage type leads to **performance and cost problems**.

## 4. A Typical IaaS-Based Architecture (Step-by-Step)

Let’s build a simple but realistic IaaS system.

### Flow:

1. User sends request
2. Load balancer receives traffic
3. Request routed to one VM
4. Application runs on VM
5. Database accessed
6. Response returned

Key point:

* **Scaling means adding or removing VMs**
* This is explicit and controlled

---

## 5. Scaling Patterns in IaaS

Scaling in IaaS is **not automatic by default**.

### Common patterns:

* manual scaling (early stages)
* scripted scaling
* auto-scaling groups (VM-based)

Trade-off:

* more control
* more responsibility
* more operational effort

This is why IaaS is powerful—but demanding.

---

## 6. When IaaS Is the Right Architectural Choice

IaaS makes sense when:

* OS-level customization is required
* Performance tuning is critical
* Legacy software must be supported
* Specialized networking is needed
* Compliance requires isolation

In these cases, PaaS may be **too restrictive**.

---

## 7. When IaaS Becomes a Liability

IaaS becomes risky when:

* team size is small
* deployments are frequent
* traffic is unpredictable
* operational maturity is low

Symptoms:

* frequent outages
* configuration drift
* security misconfigurations
* scaling delays

This is why many teams **move upward** to PaaS over time.

---

## 8. IaaS vs PaaS (Architectural Viewpoint)

| Aspect             | IaaS              | PaaS            |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Control            | Very high         | Moderate        |
| Operational effort | High              | Low             |
| Scaling            | Manual / scripted | Automatic       |
| OS access          | Full              | None            |
| Best for           | Custom systems    | APIs & services |

This table explains **why IaaS still exists**, but isn’t always preferred.

---

## 9. Designing IaaS Systems the “Senior Engineer” Way

Senior engineers using IaaS always:

* automate provisioning
* isolate networks carefully
* design for failure
* document infrastructure
* plan migration paths

IaaS without discipline becomes **unmanageable quickly**.

---

## 10. Mental Model to Remember

> **IaaS is cloud-powered infrastructure, not cloud-managed applications.**

You gain:

* freedom
* predictability
* control

You accept:

* responsibility
* operational burden
* security ownership

---

## Quick Recap

* IaaS is the foundation layer for cloud architectures
* It provides VMs, networking, and storage
* Scaling and reliability are your responsibility
* Best for custom, controlled, or legacy workloads
* Requires strong operational practices
