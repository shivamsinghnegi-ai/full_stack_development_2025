# **22: Identity as a Service (IDaaS)**

*(Why identity becomes the new security perimeter in the cloud)*

---

## 1. Why Identity Deserves Its Own Article

In traditional systems, security was mostly **network-based**:

* trusted internal networks
* firewalls at the edge
* limited entry points

Cloud changes this completely.

In cloud systems:

* resources are distributed
* services scale dynamically
* networks are shared
* users and services access from everywhere

This makes **identity**, not the network, the primary security boundary.

---

## 2. What Is Identity as a Service (IDaaS)?

**Identity as a Service (IDaaS)** is a cloud service model that provides:

* user and service identities
* authentication (who you are)
* authorization (what you can do)
* centralized access control
* auditing and visibility

Instead of every application managing users and permissions separately, identity is handled **centrally**.

---

## 3. Why Cloud Systems Rely on Identity First

In cloud environments:

* IP addresses change
* instances come and go
* services communicate dynamically

So the question shifts from:

> “Is this request coming from a trusted network?”

to:

> **“Who is making this request, and are they allowed to?”**

This identity-first thinking enables:

* zero-trust architectures
* fine-grained access control
* safer scaling

---

## 4. Core Concepts in Identity 

Understanding IDaaS requires clarity on three concepts.

### 4.1 Identity

An **identity** represents:

* a human user
* an application
* a service
* an automated process

Anything that needs access must have an identity.

---

### 4.2 Authentication (AuthN)

Authentication answers:

> **Who are you?**

Examples:

* username + password
* multi-factor authentication
* tokens
* certificates

Authentication proves identity, but **does not grant permissions**.

---

### 4.3 Authorization (AuthZ)

Authorization answers:

> **What are you allowed to do?**

Examples:

* read-only access
* admin privileges
* service-to-service permissions

Authorization always happens **after authentication**.

---

## 5. Identity-Centric Access Flow

A typical cloud access flow looks like this:

Flow:

1. Request is made
2. Identity is authenticated
3. Permissions are evaluated
4. Access is granted or denied
5. Action is logged

Security decisions are **explicit and auditable**.

---

## 6. Identity for Humans vs Identity for Services

Cloud systems distinguish between two major identity types.

### Human Identities

Used by:

* developers
* administrators
* operators

Characteristics:

* interactive access
* MFA often required
* stricter monitoring

---

### Service Identities

Used by:

* applications
* background jobs
* APIs

Characteristics:

* non-interactive
* token or certificate-based
* limited permissions
* designed for automation

Confusing these two is a **major security risk**.

---

## 7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

One of the most common IDaaS patterns is **Role-Based Access Control**.

Instead of assigning permissions directly to users:

* permissions are grouped into roles
* users are assigned roles

Example roles:

* viewer
* developer
* operator
* administrator

Benefits:

* simpler management
* fewer mistakes
* easier audits

RBAC scales far better than per-user permissions.

---

## 8. Identity as the Foundation of Zero Trust

Modern cloud security follows **zero-trust principles**:

* never trust by default
* always verify identity
* enforce least privilege
* continuously evaluate access

Identity enables:

* secure internal communication
* safer multi-tenant systems
* fine-grained control without network complexity

Zero trust is **impossible without strong identity systems**.

---

## 9. Auditing and Visibility Through Identity

Every identity-based action can be:

* logged
* traced
* audited

This enables:

* security investigations
* compliance reporting
* incident response

In cloud systems:

> **If it’s not tied to an identity, it’s not secure.**

---

## 10. Common Identity Mistakes in Cloud Systems

1. Using shared credentials
2. Granting excessive permissions
3. Hardcoding secrets in code
4. Mixing human and service access
5. Ignoring access logs

Most cloud breaches involve **identity misuse**, not infrastructure failure.

## 11. How IDaaS Fits Here

This article prepares you for:

* compliance services
* cloud security architecture
* access control design

Identity connects:

* cloud services
* service management
* security and governance

It is the **control plane of trust** in cloud systems.

---

## Mental Model to Remember

> **In the cloud, identity is the new perimeter.
> Everything else is secondary.**

Design security around identity, not networks.

---

## Quick Recap

* IDaaS centralizes identity and access control
* Authentication proves who you are
* Authorization decides what you can do
* Identity replaces network trust in cloud
* RBAC and least privilege are essential
* Auditing depends on identity
